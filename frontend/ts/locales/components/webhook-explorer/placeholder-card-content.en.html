<p>
  Here you can see how the app notices orders and forwards them to ParcelLab. The purpose of this view is to debug the app.<br />
  For example, you can edit an order to trigger the <code>order/update</code> webhook which you will then see here.
  Once a supported webhook has been triggered, a new card will appear to the left of this card.<br />
  Please note that it may take a few seconds for the webhook to appear here.
