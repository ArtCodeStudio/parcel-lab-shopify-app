<p>
  Supported webhook topics you can receive in your theme are:
  <ul>
    <li><code>products/create</code>,</li>
    <li><code>products/update</code>,</li>
    <li><code>products/delete</code> and</li>
    <li><code>app/uninstalled</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  
  Currently more webhooks are not supported for security reasons or because the need for it was not there yet.
  In addition, only webhooks of published products will be redirected to the theme.

    If you need more webhooks write us an email and we will see if we can support this webhook for you.
